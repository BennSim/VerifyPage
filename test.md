This file contains manual tests which should be later removed and automated.

1. Check if N/A(Grey), DA/NR (Blue) show up correctly if you are ON a domain with data accounting vs being on a page without it.
2. Check if DA(Green) shows on a page which has valid verification data.
3. Check if you can run manually 'Verify' page with the verification button.
4. Check if a page returns DA(Red) if the verification fails.
5. Check if DA(Black) is returned in case the API fails or another critical bug is produced.
6. Check if (fast) switching between tabs causes inconsistancies or failures.
7. Check if the cache is properly updated on page update and renewed verification.
